The pre-release version of OrthoStudio that you are using must be updated!
An updated version can be installed by either using the Osirix PluginManager (which is found in the Plugins-menu) or by visiting our web site:

The pre-release version of OrthoStudio that you are currently using will be deactivated on January 31, 2011.
